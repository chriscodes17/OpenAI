# OpenAI App for Shopify Internship Fall 2022

**Live Demo Link**: https://magenta-kashata-dca0c1.netlify.app/

**About** 
This web application uses OpenAI's GPT-3 AI model where a user can input a question or prompt and the AI will output a response. The responses are in a list with the time stamp of creation, original prompt, AI response and a delete button so the user can remove unwanted responses.

**Technology Used**
This web application was written in Javascript using the fontend framework `React.js`. I chose to use React as a framework because I recently finished learning the basics of React and React provides a fast, scalable, and simple work flow.
